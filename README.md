Explanation 

    This Android Studio Application is a Webview-based program that launches our website to run it’s UI. Webview is a common method to convert web pages into mobile applications. It allowed us to create our website using Google Sites so everyone could work on the domain. It also has a built-in camera launcher to scan QR codes. This allows us to scan the QR codes that would be found on the Landmark Station Pillars placed around the Ontario Science Centre. The QR codes contain text codes that can be entered into the search bar of the app. When entered, they take you to a hidden page that contains information about that exhibit display. 
    There are a number of Landmark Station Pillars situated on each floor (from floors 4-6) of the building. Each Landmark Station has an associated “Landmark Token”, which is obtained when scanning the QR code found on the Pillar. Collecting all the Landmark Tokens on a Floor awards you a unique digital badge for that floor which can then be printed at a printing station found on Level 2. 
    For accessibility purposes, children and parents can download the app on their phone and create their user profile, called an “Explorer Profile”. This allows you to keep track of which tokens you’ve obtained. Android tablets will also be provided by the Ontario Science Centre for those who do not have access to a compatible device.
